# azure-security-templates
Useful templates of security policies, roles and runbooks to protect your Azure account

---

## Policies

I've added just 4 policies to start with, but I'll be adding more as I go along.

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: You need to edit these policies to add your own values. 
Editable values are clearly marked.

* [Deny owner & contributor roles](policies/deny_owner_contributor_role.json)
* [Deny public critical ports](policies/deny_public_critical_ports.json)
* [Deny service principal with owner role](policies/deny_service_principal_with_owner_role.json)
* [Limit maximum users (3) with owner role](policies/limit_max_3_user_with_owner_role.json)


## Runbooks

In order to prevent most common security issues, I've added some runbooks to automate some tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: You need to edit the runbooks to add your own values. 
Editable values are at the top of the file with a comment.

* [update_exposed_ssh_rdp.ps1](runbooks/update_exposed_ssh_rdp.ps1)
* [update_users_with_admin_roles.ps1](runbooks/update_users_with_admin_roles.ps1)

## Roles

I've added just 2 roles to start with, but I'll be adding more as I go along.

* [Owner sec](roles/owner-sec.json)
* [Contributor sec](roles/contributor-sec.json)

These roles are based on the default owner and contributor roles, but with some restrictions added. **Anyway these are not safe at all** but they are better than the default ones.

I'll be adding safer roles like: `Developer`, `Devops`, `Product Owner` or `Security Auditor`.
